# House Price Prediction – Brooklyn Dumbo (Linear Regression)

This project builds a simple **linear regression model** using **scikit-learn** to predict **house prices** based on **house size (sqft)** for properties recently sold in Brooklyn’s **Dumbo** neighborhood.

> 📌 Note: The dataset is based on data gathered from **Zillow**.

## 📁 Project Overview

We aim to:

- Explore the relationship between **house size** and **sale price**  
- Train a **LinearRegression** model using `scikit-learn`  
- Evaluate the model’s performance and visualize the **best-fit line**  
- Use the trained model to **predict prices** for new house sizes  

This project is kept intentionally simple for learning purposes.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Zillow (Dumbo neighborhood, Brooklyn, NY)  
- **Typical columns** (example):
  - `size_sqft` – Size of the house in square feet  
  - `price_usd` – Sale price of the house in USD  

> Make sure your CSV file (for example: `dumbo_house_prices.csv`) has at least these two columns.
